## Below two functions create a special object that stores a matrix and cache's its inverse

## set and get the value of the matrix
## and set and get the value of the inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getsolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)
}

## calculate the inverse of matrix with the above function. 
## it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and sets the value of 
## the inverse in the cache via the setsolve function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
 ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getsolve()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(m)
  m
}
